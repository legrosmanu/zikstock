# Zikstock

Zikstock is a platform to help musicians to play music.  

How can Zikstock do this?  
Zikstock allows you to store the musical resources you need to learn a new song, decide which song to play with your friends, and so on.

A musical resource is a Web link to a tablature, a tutorial, ba acktracking,... , all you need to play music alone or together.  
You'll be able to group them as a song, and the songs as a songbook.
